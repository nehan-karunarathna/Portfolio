            <h2>SpaceX</h2>
            
            <p>SpaceX was formed by entrepreneur Elon Musk in the hopes of revolutionizing the aerospace industry and making affordable spaceflight a reality. The company entered the arena with the Falcon 1 rocket, a two-stage liquid-fueled craft designed to send small satellites into orbit. The Falcon 1 was vastly cheaper to build and operate than its competitors, a field largely populated by spacecraft built by publicly owned and government-funded companies such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Part of the rocket's cost-effectiveness was made possible by the SpaceX-developed Merlin engine, a cheaper alternative to those used by other companies. SpaceX also focused on making reusable rockets (other launch vehicles are generally made for one-time use).Falcon 1 rocket

                In March 2006 SpaceX made its first Falcon 1 launch, which began successfully but ended prematurely because of a fuel leak and fire. By this time, however, the company had already earned millions of dollars in launching orders, many of them from the U.S. government. In August of that year SpaceX was a winner of a NASA competition for funds to build and demonstrate spacecraft that could potentially service the ISS after the decommissioning of the space shuttle. Falcon 1 launches that failed to attain Earth orbit followed in March 2007 and August 2008, but in September 2008 SpaceX became the first privately owned company to send a liquid-fueled rocket into orbit. Three months later it won a NASA contract for servicing the ISS that was worth more than $1 billion.</p>

            <h2>Tesla</h2>
            
            <p>Tesla was founded in 2003 by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in San Carlos, California. It was originally called Tesla Motors, a name the company would truncate in 2017.The company was named after the 19th-century inventor Nikola Tesla, best known for discovering the properties of rotating electromagnetic fields. His work led to what is known as "alternating current," a form of electrical transmission used in most households today. (This was as opposed to the far less efficient system called "direct current" favored by Thomas Edison). When Tesla was founded in 2003, Eberhard served as its CEO, and Tarpenning served as CFO. They launched their company to develop and produce an entirely electric car after observing the favorable reaction test markets had to General Motors' (GM) previous electric car experiment, the EV1.

                Although GM only ran this program from 1996 to 1999, producing a limited run of cars that it never released for public purchase, it was generally considered successful from an engineering standpoint. Eberhard and Tarpenning wanted to build upon that success.
                
                Although Musk has long been the face of Tesla, he did not join the company until 2004. He invested $30 million into the startup and became the chairman of its board of directors.</p>
